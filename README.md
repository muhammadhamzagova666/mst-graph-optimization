# MST Graph Optimization
*Efficient MST Algorithms for Optimized Network Design*

## Overview
This repository contains a collection of implementations and experimental analyses of both naive and efficient versions of Prim's and Kruskal's algorithms for computing the Minimum Spanning Tree (MST) in undirected weighted graphs. The project includes code in both C++ and Python, catering to different performance and educational needs. Its primary focus is on optimizing fiber optic network design through advanced graph algorithms, making it an ideal reference for developers, researchers, and network engineers.

Key features include:
- **Dual-Language Implementations:** Explore both C++ and Python versions.
- **Algorithm Variants:** Compare naive vs. efficient approaches.
- **Performance Analysis:** Detailed reports and visualizations of execution times across varying graph sizes and densities.
- **Educational Value:** Clear code comments and extensive documentation to support learning and contribution.

## Technology Stack
- **C++:** (GCC, Clang) for high-performance MST implementations.
- **Python:** 3.x for experimental analysis and visualization (uses modules such as `random`, `matplotlib`, and `time`).
- **LaTeX:** For generating formal project reports.
- **Additional Tools:** Shell scripts for automation and testing.

## Installation & Setup

### Prerequisites
- **For C++ code (in `Cpp Source/`):**
  - A C++ compiler (GCC/Clang) supporting C++11 or higher.
  - CMake (optional, for project build automation).
- **For Python scripts (in `Python Source/`):**
  - Python 3.9+ and pip.
  - Required Python libraries: `matplotlib`, `numpy` (Install via `pip install matplotlib numpy`).

### Steps
1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/muhammadhamzagova666/mst-graph-optimization.git
   cd MST-Graph-Optimization
   ```

2. **C++ Build (for example, Naive Prim):**
   ```sh
   cd "Cpp Source"
   g++ Naive_Prim.cpp -o naive_prim -std=c++11
   ./naive_prim
   ```

3. **Python Setup (Jupyter Notebook):**
   Open the notebook via:
   ```sh
   cd "Python Source"
   jupyter notebook Project.ipynb
   ```

## Usage Guide

- **Running Algorithms:**  
  Execute the C++ programs for quick performance tests, or run the provided Jupyter Notebook to visualize graphs and analyze MST characteristics.  
- **Example Output:**  
  The console prints the total MST cost and execution time. In Python, graphs display edge weights and MST overlays for both static and animated views.

Each directory and file is organized to separate source code, analysis notebooks, and documentation, ensuring a clean codebase and streamlined navigation for contributors.

## Configuration & Environment Variables
- **C++:** No additional configuration is required.
- **Python:** If environment variables are needed, create a `.env` file in the root.  
  **Example:**
  ```
  DEBUG_MODE=True
  MAX_NODES=1000
  ```

## Deployment Guide
- **Local Deployment:**  
  Follow the installation steps above to compile or run the code locally.
- **Docker Deployment (Optional):**  
  You can create a Dockerfile that sets up the necessary environment for both C++ and Python environments to enable reproducible testing.
- **CI/CD Integration:**  
  Configure GitHub Actions to run unit tests and build checks on every push for continuous integration.

## Testing & Debugging
- **C++:**  
  Insert debug print statements to trace memory allocation and algorithm steps. Run the executable from a terminal to capture outputs.
- **Python:**  
  Utilize Jupyter Notebook cells to run individual tests. Use Python’s built-in `unittest` module or pytest for automated testing.

## Performance Optimization
- Compare execution times between naive and efficient versions.
- Use profiling tools (e.g., gprof for C++, cProfile for Python) to identify bottlenecks.
- Adjust the data structures (e.g., array vs. heap) based on graph density.

## Security Best Practices
- Validate inputs for graph generation to prevent unexpected runtime errors.
- For production deployment, ensure that all libraries are regularly updated to mitigate vulnerabilities.
- Follow secure coding guidelines for C++ (e.g., memory management best practices).
